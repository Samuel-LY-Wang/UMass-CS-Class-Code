Improvements to make:
1. More enemies (perhaps some weaker and some stronger)
2. Multiple waves of enemies that ramp up in difficulty
3. Some sort of a stat/item shop between waves
4. Choosing which enemy to attack
5. Different attacks (like an AoE for example)
6. A "shield" that blocks some damage
7. Adding choice of user class (thinking between like basic, ranged, tank, melee, and wizard)
8. Add class-specific attacks (mainly for the wizard, being able to use magic, maybe the tank being able to like "earthquake" or something idk)
9. Making attacks more random (like dealing a random amount of damage)
10. Improving enemy AI to allow it to sometimes heal or something
11. Refactoring to optimize

NOTE: ALL IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE MADE IN A SEPARATE DIRECTORY DUE TO CHANGE 11 BREAKING SOME BITS RELATED TO THE AUTOGRADER
IMPROVEMENTS ARE UNDER THE game/ DIRECTORY
